USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
==================
import joblib

# Load the best model
model_package = joblib.load('best_power_generation_model.pkl')
model = model_package['model']
scaler = model_package['scaler']  # May be None for Random Forest
features = model_package['feature_names']
performance = model_package['performance_metrics']

# For production deployment, implement the complete feature engineering
# pipeline to match the training process.
